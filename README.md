# Linux-Process-Monitor
Linux Process Monitor is a system utility tool built to track, display, and manage processes running on a Linux system. It mimics core features of tools like top, htop, or ps, offering users real-time insights into CPU and memory usage, process states, and the ability to control processes (e.g., kill, suspend, resume).
